<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

FOR agricultural researchers and plant scientists
WHO need a faster, more accurate way to identify roots in soil images without damaging the plants, 
THE Root-Segmentation is a deep learning-based root image segmentation tool 
THAT automatically and reliably detects root structures in in situ images, enabling large-scale, high-throughput analysis of root traits. 
UNLIKE manual tracing or threshold-based software that suffers from soil noise and subjectivity, 
OUR PRODUCT adapts and validates proven research methods specifically to in situ root images, to deliver 2 ready-to-use segmentation models and binary masks tailored to real-world research datasets.


### Built With

* SegMATE
* Photoshop



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You can get started by installing SegMATE onto your computer and selecting the ONNX model.


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

### Week 7
- Refine Dataset #1  
- Begin training  

### Week 8
- Start labelling Dataset #2  
- Continue training  
- No tutor meeting  

### Week 9
- Finish training  
- Handover:
  - User guide for labeling tools: **SegMATE**, **Photoshop**, **Songshen Method**, **Manual Drawing Tools**, etc
  - User guide for our trained models: **RPT**
  - Notes for Students  
  - Notes for Clients  

### Week 10
- Show the handover delivery plan (repo needs to have a clear README.md and a user guide to use the tool/model, handover notes, etc)
- Poster and pitch due  

### Week 11
- No tutor meeting  

### Week 12
- Final Delivery due
- Final Showcase Tue 12-2pm
